## About The Project

The sole purpose of this project is to help others with math. Especially in lower school, math is an important lesson. Falling behind can sometimes mean not being able to follow math anymore. To prevent this from happening, I have developed a math game for children in which they can learn about 
Mental arithmetic, triads and other games that help with math!
